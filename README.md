# H1 Jakub Ostaszewski
### H3 My first User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project for Code Institute.
I was required to create a Milestone Project based on everything I learned so far.
The project will consist of a blog website, and I will be using the first three modules of the course, mainly. 
In this case, I am going to use HDML for the writing, CSS to design the website itself and Bootstrap
in order to build a mobile version.

## H2 UXac

The content creator of the website is a vegan activist who wants to share helpful information, such as 
food recipes, activism events' times and locations, tips for sustainability...
In addition, there will be links to external websites to support the content creator's articles with different types 
of media by certified professionals, including videos, documentaries, podcasts...
This way, the readers will have a go-to site in case unsure about what to cook but also medical studies related to 
health and meat consumption, for example.
The purpose of the websites' owner is to create a great community with the same interests who would help 
and interact with each other while spreading awareness of the suffering of animals in meat and dairy industries.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
