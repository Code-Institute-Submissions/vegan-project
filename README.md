# Jakub Ostaszewski
##  My first User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project for Code Institute.
I was required to create a Milestone Project based on everything I learned so far.
The project will be a blog website, for which I will be using the first three modules of the course, mainly. 
In this case, I am going to use HTML to write all the texts, CSS to design the website itself and Bootstrap in order to build a mobile version.

# Idea
At first, the project was going to be a restaurant's website.
As it is my first milestone project, I wanted to use as much knowledge as possible from what I learned during the course. Therefore, I decided to create a vegan activism website instead, as I thought this idea is more innovative and original; and also, it allows me to share a bit of my own ideals.

# UXac

The content creator of the website is a group of animal rights activists.
Fistly, their main goal is to share information in order to, not only spread awareness and help end the animal abuse, but also help people make more healthy food choices such as a plant based diet, which would also have a better impact in our environment.

Also, the website will be used as a platform where those interested in making the switch to a vegan lifestyle will be able to find tips, others' expieriences, activism speeches...

Furthermore, visitors will also be able to read the group's story on their origin as vegan and why they decided to join the fight for animals rights.

## As a visitor.
1. As a visitor, I want to know what all this is about and how it started.
2. As a visitor, I want be shown ways to get involved to help the cause.
3. As a visitor, I would like to make part of a growing community.
4. As a visitor, I want to find ideas on how to sart being vegan.
5. As a visitor, I want to be able to contact the group, in case of need.

## As the Owner.
1. As the owner, I want to share my story and my goal as an activist.
2. As the owner, I want to make visitors realize that animals need their help.
3. As the owner, I want to show everyone, the group whose work is behind this project.
4. As the owner, I want to give the visitor as many resources as needed to become vegan.
4. As the owner, I want to give them ideas on how to help the animals.
5. As the owner, I want to give the visitor the chance to contact us if they have any questions or suggestions.

2. mockups

## Coloristic
The website's background color is green. Since there are many pictures of nature, I think this color will make a cohersive design.
Many text boxes have different images as a background.
In addition, I wanted the social media icons keep their original colors in order to make them easy to recognize.
Therefore, Facebook is dark blue; Instagram, pink; Twitter, light blue and Youtube, red.

## Features

The website will consist of 4 sections:
* Home 
* About
* Activism
* Contact

The navigation menu bar includes (from left to right) a Home, About, Activism and Contact section.
As the menu bar is not static, it moves along in every section, so it is visible the whole time, even while scrolling down.
There is another navigation bar on the left side with the social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube.
Each one of them have a different background color with a similar design but different icon.
Icons are white with a blue hover effect when the cursor is pointing on them.

The title 'Vegan for the Voiclees' and the logo, move along as the menu bar on every section, each time with a different background. 

As I put the social media bar on the left side of the page as footer, the visitors are asked for their feedback next to a navigation button that leads to the contact section.

1. Home :
I kept this section simple by setting a moving menu bar on the very top and the social media links on left side.
Under the Menu bar, I chose a picture of two cows in a green valley as a backgroud.

The next picture shows the main creator of the project in order to add a short text introducing him below.

This narrative, started on top of the cows picture background and continued right under other three pictures, covers three parts: 
* First, when he became a vegan and what his diet was like back then.
* Next, there is a mention to his research about this movement.
* And finally, the idea to start the activist group and the website.

2. About Us

The title and the logo are located right under menu bar.
Next, I added two pictures and an introdution text of these group memebers in separate white boxes,
both on the right of each picture.
Under that, I putplaced the motivational speech video by Philip Wollen .

After the video, the is a white background text box about the origin of the group as if written by the members themselves.
The rest of the section is made up by pictures of the remaining group members and their reason to go vegan on top of each picture.

3. Activism

As in the rest of the sections, the title is shown at the very top.
The background selected is a vegan march picture and, on top of it,
there is a white text box with a suggestive sentence.

The remaining part of this section will consist of a green plain background containing the next:
Right under the picture, there is another significative sentence within a text box.

Following,  there are four different images of animals abused by the industries that either sell or test on them.
The first one is a small duck who suffered some kind of an injury.
The second one is a herd of young pigs in a small closed part of a farm.
The next one is a picture of several rabbits kept on laboratories in order to be tested on.
In the last picture there is a caged monkey used for millitary research.

Under every picture there is a title for the texts that show up only when the cursor is on the any of them.
These texts were created in order to show everyone how they can help this poor animals and what these industries are doing to them.

4. Contact

As the name indicates, this section is where visitors will be able to get in touch with the owner, ask questions and make any suggestions.

There are several text boxes which include: name, email address, phone number and message.

# Technology Used :

## Programing Languages:
* HTML - Was used to build the Dashboard structure.
* Css - describes the appearance of the website.

## Libraries:

* Bootstrap - It is a really useful framework based on Css , I used it for the menu navigation bar and to design the mobile version.
* Bootstrap fonts - Font Icons Library used mainly for the social media bar.
* Google Fonts - Full of different text fonts, I used only one of them for all the texts in the website.

## Coding and Storing Platforms:
* Gitpod - Platform used for coding and storing repository.
* Visual Studio Code - used for the same aim as Gitpod, once the limit amount of hours on this platform were reached.
* Github - Used to store the final version of the project and also throughout the creation process for all the needed changes.

# Testing:

I tested every link manually.
The menu bar works correctlly.
All the social media links are responding.
The 'contact' button leads to the contact section.
Iframe works correctly.
All the pictures look clear.
I fixed each and every debug.

## Code validators
* Css validator - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload

1. main.css -Css validator showed me three simple errors, so I fixed them imediatelly.

* HTML validator - https://validator.w3.org/

1. Index.html - showed me 2 warnings "Section lacks heading"
2. About.html - showed me 4 Warnings "Section lacks heading"
3. Active.html - showed me 1 Warning "Section lacks heading"
4. Contact.html - No errors or warnings to show.

All the above warnings were expected as heading were not added on purpose. Therefore, the warnings were not eliminated.

## Responsiveness 

* I tested every button throughout the process of building the site.
* I checked if my website would respond and what it would look like on several device sizes using the "Toogle device toolbar" tool from Google Chrome.
* I repeated the second step on the next site as well 
  http://ami.responsivedesign.is/  
## Bugs

Iniatially, I could not seperate my CSS file from HTML files, since everytime I tried, CSS stopped responding. Eventually, I added all the files together in the same folder
I first created a video comment section to add a youtube link, but the video was not appearing on the section, so I decided to copy the Iframe from youtube.

# Contact

I checked my Contact section form :
* by typing on each field - it typed as it should
* The email field must contain the "@" symbol. Otherwise, the form cannot be submitted and it will show up this message: "Please include an @ in your email address"
* If the send button is clicked but any of the form fields is empty, an error message will appear asking the visitor to fill all the fields. 
* I tried to submit an invalid email address and error message appears
* As this project consists of Bootstrap, CSS and HTML only, the option to send the form it is available but not working, since Javascript would be needed for that and it does not make part of this project resources. However, if used, the form would actually be sent correctly.
# Deployment
The project was posted in Github, manually from my PC as I used the 50h avalaible every month to use this program:
I deployed them in the following way:
* I opened my vegan project in github

# Inspiration

My inspiration was my girlfriend and, since we both are vegan, our lifestyle.
As we have performed deep researches about this subject, I thought it is a practical and exciting idea to create a blog for activists.

If eventually, I have to create something similar for an employer, I will already know a lot about the subject.

# Acknowledgements

I really want to thank to whole team from Code Institute for their constant support and periodic checks on my performance, and besides, for the huge amount of resources and useful material provided, which made this project possible.
