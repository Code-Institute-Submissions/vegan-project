# Jakub Ostaszewski
##  My first User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project for Code Institute.
I was required to create a Milestone Project based on everything I learned so far.
The project will be a blog website, for which I will be using the first three modules of the course, mainly. 
In this case, I am going to use HTML to write all the texts, CSS to design the website itself and Bootstrap in order to build a mobile version.

# Idea
At first, the project was going to be a restaurant's website.
As it is my first milestone project, I wanted to use as much knowledge as possible from what I learned during the course. Therefore, I decided to create a vegan activism website instead, as I thought this idea is more innovative and original; and also, it allows me to share a bit of my own ideals.

# UXac

The content creator of the website is a group of animal rights activists.
Fistly, their main goal is to share information in order to, not only spread awareness and help end the animal abuse, but also help people make more healthy food choices such as a plant based diet, which would also have a better impact in our environment.

Also, the website will be used as a platform where those interested in making the switch to a vegan lifestyle will be able to find tips, others' expieriences, activism speeches...

Furthermore, visitors will also be able to read the group's story on their origin as vegan and why they decided to join the fight for animals rights.

## As a visitor.
1. As a visitor, I want to know what all this is about and how it started.
2. As a visitor, I want be shown ways to get involved to help the cause.
3. As a visitor, I would like to make part of a growing community.
4. As a visitor, I want to find ideas on how to sart being vegan.
5. As a visitor, I want to be able to contact the group, in case of need.

## As the Owner.
1. As the owner, I want to share my story and my goal as an activist.
2. As the owner, I want to make visitors realize that animals need their help.
3. As the owner, I want to show everyone, the group whose work is behind this project.
4. As the owner, I want to give the visitor as many resources as needed to become vegan.
4. As the owner, I want to give them ideas on how to help the animals.
5. As the owner, I want to give the visitor the chance to contact us if they have any questions or suggestions.

Design

## Coloristic
The website's background color is green. Since there are many pictures of nature, I think this color will make a cohersive design.
Many text boxes have different images as a background.
In addition, I wanted the social media icons keep their original colors in order to make them easy to recognize.
Therefore, Facebook is dark blue; Instagram, pink; Twitter, light blue and Youtube, red.

## Features

The website will consist of 4 sections:
* Home 
* About
* Activism
* Contact

The navigation menu bar includes (from left to right) a Home, About, Activism and Contact section.
As the menu bar is not static, it moves along in every section, so it is visible the whole time, even while scrolling down.
There is another navigation bar on the left side with the social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube.
Each one of them have a different background color with a similar design but different icon.
Icons are white with a blue hover effect when the cursor is pointing on them.

The title ( ``Vegan for the Voiclees´´) and the logo, move along as the menu bar on every section, each time with a different background. 

As I put the social media bar on the left side of the page as footer, the visitors are asked for their feedback next to a navigation button that leads to the contact section.

1. Home :
I kept this section simple by setting a moving menu bar on the very top and the social media links on left side.
Under the Menu bar, I chose a picture of two cows in a green valley as a backgroud.

The next picture shows the main creator of the project in order to add a short text introducing him below.

This narrative, started on top of the cows picture background and continued right under other three pictures, covers three parts: 
* First, when he became a vegan and what his diet was like back then.
* Next, there is a mention to his research about this movement.
* And finally, the idea to start the activist group and the website.

2. About Us

The title and the logo are located right under menu bar.
Next, I added two pictures and an introdution text of these group memebers in separate white boxes,
both on the right of each picture.
Under that, I putplaced the motivational speech video by Philip Wollen .

After the video, the is a white background text box about the origin of the group as if written by the members themselves.
The rest of the section is made up by pictures of the remaining group members and their reason to go vegan on top of each picture.

3. Activism

On the background picture full of activists I stated the Title.
We can find there also short text on the middle of picture on the white background.
I located under this four picture on the green background with text animation.
Suffering duck picture is first ,when cursor is on ,text show on and show of when cursor is not on the box.
Texts are created in order to show the people how they can help this poor animals and what is happening for them in the industries,army research and laboratorys.
The rest pictures have the same effects and text about the same order but different content ,second picture is with pigs suffering in industries, third its the rabbits in laboratorys and the last one thats the monkey in cage used for military research. 

4. Contact

As the name indicates, this section is where visitors will be able to get in touch with the owner, ask questions and make any suggestions.

There are several text boxes which include: name, email address, phone number and message.

# Technology Used :

## Programing Languages:
* HTML - Was used to build the Dashboard structure.
* Css - describes the appearance of a website.

## Libraries:

* Bootstrap - It is a really useful framework based on Css , I used it for the menu bar navigation bar and to design mobile version.
* Bootstrap fonts - Font Icons Library used mainly for  the social media.
* Google Fonts - Full of text fonts, in my project I used one of them.

## Coding and Storing Platforms:
* Gitpod - Platform used for coding and storing repository.
* Visual Studio Code - the same as Gitpod I corrected my project there as on the Gitpod I get the limit.
* Github - Store final version of my Project.

# Testing:

I tested every link manually.
The menu bar works correctlly.
All the social media links are responding.
The contact button leads to the contact section.
iframe works correctly.
All the pictures look clear.
I fixed each and every debug.

## Code validators
* Css validator - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload

1. main.css -Css validator showed me three simple errors, so I fixed them imediatelly.

* HTML validator - https://validator.w3.org/

1. Index.html - showed me 2 warnings "Section lacks heading"
I ignored that because I know it can apear.
2. About.html - showed me 4 Warnings "Section lacks heading"
I ignored that because I know it can apear.
3. Active.html - showed me 1 Warning "Section lacks heading"
I ignored that because I know it can apear.
4. Contact.html - No errors or warnings to show .

## Responsiveness 

* I tested every button throughout the process of building the site.
* I checked what my website would respond and look like on the several device sizes using the "Toogle device toolbar" tool from Google Chrome.
* I checked my website on this site http://ami.responsivedesign.is/  
## Bugs

Iniatially, I could not seperate my CSS file from HTML files, since everytime I tried, CSS stopped responding. Eventually, I added all the files together in the same folder
I first created a video comment section to add a youtube link, but the video was not appearing on the section, so I decided to copy the Iframe from youtube.

# Contact

I checked my Contact section form :
* by typing on each field - it typed as it should
* if I didn´t write @ on the email field it shows me error "Please include an @..."
* 

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact" section
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
# Deployment
The project was hosted in Github, manually from my PC as I used the 50h avalaible every month to use this program:
I deployed them in the following way:
* I opened my vegan project in github 
* I pressed Add file button 
* Choose upload files
* From the options drag or choose files, I clicked on the second one to add all my files to the project.
* Later I scrolled down and clicked on the commit changes button to saved all this changes.

# Credits
## Images
* All the pictures on the website came were downloaded from random websites.
* The icons used are from bootstrap fonts library. 
## Video
* Inspirational speech by Philip Wollen - https://www.youtube.com/embed/vBx7MGIZ1fU
## Text
* Most of the text in about.html and active.html was made up, based on influencer activists I actually follow on social media.
* The rest, is a mix of personal stories of my own or people I have met at events or fairs.

# Inspiration

My inspiration was my girlfriend and, since we both are vegan, our lifestyle.
As we have performed deep researches about this subject, I thought it is a practical and exciting idea to create a blog for activists.

If eventually, I have to create something similar for an employer, I will already know a lot about the subject.

# Acknowledgements

I really want to thank to whole team from Code Institute for their constant support and periodic checks on my performance, and besides, for the huge amount of resources and useful material provided, which made this project possible.
